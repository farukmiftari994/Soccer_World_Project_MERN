This project is a web application built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) focused on creating and managing soccer player cards. The application allows an admin to create unique player cards, which include details like the player's name, position, statistics etc.

Users can browse and select cards to add to their personal collection. However, each player card can only be owned by one user at a time. Once a user claims a card, it becomes unavailable to others. This ensures a unique and exclusive collection for each user.

The system maintains the integrity and uniqueness of the cards, providing a competitive and engaging experience for soccer enthusiasts to collect and showcase their favorite players.
